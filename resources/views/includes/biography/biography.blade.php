    <p class="text-white mx-56 mb-5 text-xl">I am an artist living and working in Madison, Alabama.</p>
    <p class="text-white mx-56 mb-5 text-xl">My family moved from Mobile to Huntsville when, in 1956, my father was hired to manage Dr Von Braun’s computer
        laboratory during the Mercury through Apollo eras. Huntsville’s out-of-doors was easily accessible to a young boy
        at that time, and my days were often spent in the woods or fields above Jones Valley at the feet of the chain of
        mountains toward the east. My early interest in painting and drawing meshed easily with what I was learning to
        do with my hands. These beginnings centered my work on Alabama landscapes and the worlds around me in general.
        My primary medium for many years was watercolor but upon retirement oil painting has become my preferred medium
        for most subjects. I have recently become fascinated with the world of birds and their physical characteristics.
        I learned to photograph them with clarity and they have become a challenging theme in my work. I enjoy bringing
        them, larger than life, face to face with the viewer in the same way we encounter them in nature.</p>
    <p class="text-white mx-56 text-xl mb-5">I spent nearly my entire career as an illustrator, artist and graphic designer.
        I co-managed and co-founded several design studios including Felder&Thames and the Grapheteria cooperative with
        Brien O’Brien. Brien and I also co-founded founded the Upstairs Gallery on Washington Street in the mid-1970s,
        likely Huntsville’s first private outlet for the work of local artists</p>
    <p class="text-white mx-56 text-xl mb-5">
        In recent years my work has taken on an intent that it did not previously possess: the preservation in images and
        impressions of the remnants of an outdoors I knew as a child and have enjoyed through the many years since.
        What I once pursued for its beauty has become my pursuit for its immortality. Without portraying panic or alarm,
        I like for my paintings to invoke the feeling of staying one step ahead of disappearance. Everything I paint is
        a real place, usually nearby, often threatened. Some of my subjects transcend averageness only for a brief and
        special time when the everyday is suddenly displaced by the atmosphere of a moment: the bloom of a redbud tree
        on a particular morning or a crack of light through the clouds. I seek opportunities where the fading naturalness
        of the old landscapes are challenged by the disruption of the new, without visible sentimentality or judgement.</p>
    <p class="text-white mx-56 text-xl mb-5">I paint to remind you of both. </p>
